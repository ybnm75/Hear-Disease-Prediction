Heart Disease Prediction Model
Overview
This project involves the development of a heart disease prediction model using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms. A user-friendly interface built with Tkinter allows users to interact with the model easily.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can assess the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters. The model is implemented using two machine learning algorithms:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
A Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) enables users to input health data and receive predictions without needing to understand the underlying code.

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ybnm75/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

Run the Tkinter GUI:
appinter.py
Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
Model Training: Implementation of KNN and MLP algorithms for heart disease prediction.
User Interface: A Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to input their health data and get predictions.
How to Use
Launch the Tkinter GUI by running the appinter.py script.
Enter the required health parameters into the input fields.
Click the "Predict" button to receive the prediction results.
The GUI will display whether the user is at risk of heart disease based on the input data.
Results
The model provides a straightforward prediction on the likelihood of heart disease, making it accessible for non-technical users. Detailed evaluation results of the models are included in the results/ directory.
